# Responsive-Web-Design I & II

We will be using the same codebase for Responsive Web Design I and II modules.  You have been provided design mock ups for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices located in the `design-files` folder.  

## Project 1: Adaptive Layout

For project 1 you will build an adaptive website that has max-width breakpoints at 400px and 768px based on the designs provided to you in this repository.  You have been provided desktop styles so you can focus on your media queries.

*Concepts required to complete the task:*
* How to use min and max-width
* Media queries using max-width
* Flexbox layout techniques are preferred

Remember that an adaptive layout updates at breakpoints only.  Don't worry about fluid layouts for this challenge.

*Tasks to complete:*
* Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 400px, 768px.  
* Review each design file and adjust your styles at each breakpoint. **Hint: Change your container class to width: 100% at the 768px breakpoint.**
* No horizontal scroll bars are acceptable at the exact breakpoint.  At 400px and 768px you should only see a vertical scrollbar.  Everything else is fine to have a horizontal scroll bar as this is not fully responsive.

* Once you have completed these tasks, reach out to your Project Manager for approval before moving into the stretch goal.

* *Stretch Goal:* Once you have completed the project with max-width media queries, start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like.


## Project 2: Fully Responsive Website

Now that you have introduced media queries into your project, it's time to upgrade your adaptive site to a full on responsive layout.  

To accomplish this challenge you will need to incorporate your knowedges of max and min width, media queries, rem units, and percents.

*Tasks to complete:*
* Convert all fixed widths into percents.
* Convert all left and right margins and paddings into percents.
* Convert all font-size pixels into rem units.

* *Stretch Goal:* See how close you can get to the media query and still have your site look decent.  Hint: you may need to introduce a few more media queries!
