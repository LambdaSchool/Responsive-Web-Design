						<li>Constrain your container element with a max-width of 880px</li>
						<li>Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 800px and 500px</li>
						<li>Convert all fixed widths, left and right margins and paddings throughout the site into percents. You will know this is working if you never see a horizontal scroll bar when you resize your browser.</li>
						<li>Convert all font-size values into rem units</li>

						<li>Look at BEM and convert your existing CSS into the appropriate selectors.</li>

					The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a 
					thousand ships with more fire power than I've... 
					There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. 
					It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! 
					No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. 
					Where did it come from?

						Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! 
						What happened? 
						I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! 
						Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something.

						I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge.
